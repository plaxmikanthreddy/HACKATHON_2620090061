### Household Water-Usage & Billing Monitor

**1a) Data Types:**

Write a Java program to store and display the following details of a household:

- Number of family members – integer
- Water consumed in litres – decimal value
- House number – integer
- Water usage status – character

Use appropriate Java data types for each value and display all the details.

---

**1b) If-Else Condition:**

Write a Java program to calculate the water bill based on water consumption. Read the water consumption in litres.

- If consumption is 500 litres or less, the bill is Rs.100.
- If consumption is more than 500 litres, the bill is Rs.200.

Use an **if-else** statement and display the water bill.

---

**1c) Methods:**

Write a Java program to calculate the total water consumption of a household using a method.

Create the following method:

`calculateTotal(int morningUsage, int eveningUsage)`

The method should return the total water consumption. Read the morning and evening water usage from the user, call the method, and display the total consumption.


2. Write a Java program to implement a Cinema Ticket Booking System.

Create a class named MovieTicket with the following data members: movieName, ticketPrice and numberOfTickets.

Create a parameterized constructor to initialize the movie name, ticket price and number of tickets.

Implement the following methods:

calculateTotal() - Calculates the total ticket amount using ticket price × number of tickets.
calculateDiscount() - Provides a 10% discount if the number of tickets is 5 or more. Otherwise, no discount is given.
calculateFinalAmount() - Calculates the final amount after deducting the discount.
displayBill() - Displays the movie name, ticket price, number of tickets, discount and final amount.
In the main() method, read the required input values and create a MovieTicket object using the constructor. Invoke the required methods to calculate the total amount, discount and final amount. Finally, display the complete booking bill.

Use separate methods for each calculation and display monetary values with two decimal places.
